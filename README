CM-11.0 NEW THEME ENGINE THEME!

This is my contribution to celebrate the new theme engine.

I have chosen to have this theme as an open source project, the 
source code can be used as a template, source code is available here

https://github.com/elelinux/GreatFreedom

For those who want the theme Great Freedom with boot animation, I have made 2 versions, 
Note: just install on newer devices that have at least 512 mb of RAM memory

Great Freedom with boot animation 768x1280

Uninstall play store version before installing this

DISCLAIMER: I take no responsibility if your phone does not boot up with the boot animationï»¿

To build this theme use eclipse or android-studio, to build from the source
for a rom for eg. description can be found at the bottom

GreatFreedom is a theme that is stylishly designed with solid colors, 
I tried to keep it as close to stock CM as possible apart from the icons.
